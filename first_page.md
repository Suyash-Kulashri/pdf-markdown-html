**PRODUCT DESCRIPTION**

![](images/LCM3000.pdf-0-0.png)


Advanced Energy’s Artesyn LCM3000 series provide for a very
wide range of AC-DC embedded power requirement. Featuring
high build quality with robust screw terminals, long life, and typical
full-load efficiency of greater than 90 percent, these units are ideal
for use in industrial and medical applications. They are backed by a
comprehensive set of industrial and medical safety approvals and
certificates. Variable-speed ‘Smart Fans’ draw on software controls
developed by Advanced Energy to match fan speed to the unit’s
cooling requirement and load current. Slowing the fan not only
saves power but also reduces wear, thus extending its life.
